### Deep Learning

Recent books include
[Bishop & Bishop, Deep Learning: Foundations and Concepts](https://www.bishopbook.com),
[Simon Prince, Understanding Deep Learning](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/),
[Zhang et al, Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai), and
[Jurafsky and Martin, Speech and Language Processing, 3rd ed](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/).
These all have free previews online, and _Zhang et al._ provides Jupyter notebooks
for most sections using PyTorch and other frameworks.

[Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai) has released a one-hour
[intro to LLMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g&t=3221s)
as well as a multi-part
[Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy/playlists) series building
a language model from the ground up.
Grant Sanderson (3Blue1Brown) made an extraordinary
[visual introduction](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)
to neural networks and transformers. Many of Jeremy Howard's
[videos](https://www.youtube.com/@howardjeremyp/videos) are also very good.
