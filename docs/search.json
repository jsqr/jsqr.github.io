    "text": "Synthetic data and property-based testing\nWhen synthetic data is used for training or fine-tuning, it makes sense to think of it as data. But in the context of evaluation, you can also think of this process as a kind of stochastic property-based testing, where we verify that a circuit we think ought to exist based on our understanding of the problem is in fact closed.\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph LR\n    segment -- create_query --&gt; query\n    query -- retrieve --&gt; segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt turns out there’s a whole lore around property-based testing, often exploiting formal properties of domain objects and operations on them. E.g. (following Wlaschin 2014):\n\ncommutative relationships (and model-based approaches),\ninvertible operations,\ninvariance under transformation,\nidempotence, and\nstructural induction.\n\nThe example given above fits the ‘invertible operations’ paradigm, where the operations are ‘given a query, retrieve a responsive segment’ and ‘given a segment, generate a plausible query’. But really, for lots of properties involving a generation step you could collect a dataset of generated examples and call it synthetic evaluation data.\nReferences:\n\nClaessen, K. and Hughes, J.
