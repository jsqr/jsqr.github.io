    "text": "Background\nI came to law school after spending several years doing data analysis and modeling in the physical sciences and finance. In contrast to those fields, legal practice seemed old-fashioned. How could I automate a process? How could I make sense of everything I was reading? Are we still in the nineteenth century or what? For all of its zeal to tackle new problems, law remained in many ways stuck in the past when it came to actually doing the work. It was frustrating, and I even wrote a Note about it as a kind of protest.\nWe’re now in a different era, and the current crop of transformer-based language models promises to make lots of ideas that were enticingly out of reach a decade or two ago much closer. How can we take advantage of the new AI tools?\n\nCaveat lector: this list is clearly a bit scattered and idiosyncratic. Among other things, it doesn’t include any individual papers. May it improve over time!"

But laws are spread across jurisdictions and different levels of government, and are framed in technical language that can be difficult to encode for analysis. Since 2024, I have been working with collaborators on a project to apply large language models and modern retrieval methods to make encoding of laws easier, focusing on the municipal codes and ordinances of hundreds of citites in the United States. This is part of a broader interest in making law more accessible."

Okay—nothing special so far. There are lots of course videos and lecture notes on the web now. What’s more remarkable is that the entire course—lectures and homeworks—is structured around interactive notebooks mixing explanatory text, worked examples, and exercises.\nThis is a brilliant way to organize a course. And, of course, it’s not entirely new. Wolfram has been sponsoring books that are essentially Mathematica notebook printouts since at least the early 90s. And the idea of a notebook interface borrows from Knuth’s literate programming. But somehow bundling everything together in a consistent package on the web makes a difference, inviting engagement and experimentation. It takes on the spirit of an upper-level physics lab, where you are given background reading, equipment, aims, and some high-level notes on procedure, but have enough options and flexibility to make things interesting.\nI worked through the Fall 2024 version of the course because I was interested in the core topics (epidemic models, climate science, and the Julia programming language). I wonder, though, if the main thing I took away was enthusiasm for this style of teaching technical information."

Begin with adapting existing coding agents, just to get a sense of the possibilities of working with text in the same way programmers work with computer languages. Then, progress through a sequence of notebooks, demonstrating approaches to increasingly complex legal tasks.\nAlong the way, we’d need to explore answers to several questions. Programming languages have compilers (or interpreters), linters, type-checkers, assertions, and test suites; how can we adapt those ideas to legal language? What is the equivalent of formal verification for natural language, and is it worth the trouble? How do we handle editing and versioning? Coding agents are currently a bit like REPLs; what’s the right user interface for other modes of development? Is there something like ‘literate programming’ when the object code is itself a contorted form of natural language?\nI wouldn’t expect to come up with definitive answers to those questions, which are both difficult and vague, but it is important to adopt a point of view on at least some of them."

Exercises would be in the form of interactive notebooks with explanatory text, background references, and some scaffolding and examples already in place to make things more accessible.\n\nPrelude. Reading on the recent history of neural networks, transformers, and language models. Augmentation versus automation: what factors make technology positive or negative, and for which groups? Moving beyond the chatbot: data curation, coding agents & tools. Exercise: develop several agent skills to aid legal problems. Example: extracting citations from a brief along with a summary of the relevant rule of law.\nUsing Language Models through an API. Legal topic: regulation of the legal profession; unauthorized practice of law. Python and technical infrastructure review. Exercise: set up infrastructure (notebooks, dependency management, API keys) for the rest of the sequence. Practice extracting structured data from text and generating summaries.\nEmbeddings, classification, and retrieval. Legal topic: statutes, court opinions, and applying legal rules to facts. Exercise: implement a classifier for legal clauses in two ways (few-shot prompting and using kNN and embeddings). Implement a retrieval tool for legal texts.\nWorking with legal texts. Structural properties of legal texts: outlines, headings, citations, rules, and entities. Exercise: redo the example from first-week exercise (extracting citations and summarizing rules) in computer code.\nEvaluation. Legal topic: professional ethics and use of technology (competence; confidentiality, privacy and security). Simple metrics and strategies for evaluating classification, retrieval, and quality of generated output. Exercise: characterize (a) classification performance on a simple labeled dataset, (b) retrieval performance, and (c) performance on generating summaries of legal rules.\nLogic, law, and automated reasoning. Classical propositional and predicate logic. Modal logic, defeasible logic, and temporal logic or situation/event calculus. Approaches to automated reasoning. Legal topic: civil law jurisdictions. Exercise: try evaluating legal propositions by ‘faking’ formal logic. Where do you draw the line between capturing relevant domain logic (the logic of a legal rule) and falling back on the language model’s sea of background knowledge? Compare results in toy examples to automated reasoning systems like the Z3 SMT solver or Prolog.\nTabular data. Legal topic: contracts and litigation discovery. Overview of commercial applications. Exercise: build a tabular analysis tool for collections of legal documents, building on the previous exercises.\nEthics & citation-checking. AI ethics: transparency, explainability and interpretability, biases, errors. Ethics of assistive tools for citations. Exercise: build a system that operates over a corpus of interlinked documents, checking citations to other documents in the corpus and checking that the references actually support the claims, and presenting results for human verification. Build a knowledge graph from the citations in a set of cases and a simple ‘Shepardizing’ tool.\nSpecifications & drafting aids. Legal topic: drafting a legal memo. Exercise: build a tool to aid drafting legal texts. Generated text should be a fragment of a legal document, based on a precedent, satisfying requirements (i.e., checked using a suite of specs or tests), and making claims grounded in cited authorities.\nFine-tuning. Legal topic: Regulation of AI. Basics of fine-tuning models using Axolotl or similar tools. Exercise: reimplement one of the functional elements you’ve built in previous modules (e.g., extracting citations) by fine-tuning a small model. Evaluate task performance as well as resource requirements; can you maintain quality while increasing speed and efficiency on the task?\nOrchestration. Legal topic: Government and AI. Compare approaches to orchestrating AI functions: coding agents and skills, programming frameworks, tools & MCP. Exercise: create a legal agent for working with precedents, specifications, and authorities to produce fragments of legal text to serve as first drafts of a memo."

E.g. (following Wlaschin 2014):\n\ncommutative relationships (and model-based approaches),\ninvertible operations,\ninvariance under transformation,\nidempotence, and\nstructural induction.\n\nThe example given above fits the ‘invertible operations’ paradigm, where the operations are ‘given a query, retrieve a responsive segment’ and ‘given a segment, generate a plausible query’.\nBut really, for lots of properties that involve a generation step you could collect a dataset of generated examples and call it synthetic evaluation data.\nReferences:\n\nClaessen, K. and Hughes, J.
