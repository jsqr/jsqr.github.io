## Overview

Legal epidemiology – understanding the effects of laws on health – requires an
understanding of what the law is. But laws are spread across jurisdictions and
different levels of government, and are framed in technical language that can be
difficult to encode for analysis. Since 2024, I have been working with
collaborators on a project to apply large language models and modern retrieval
methods to make encoding of laws easier, focusing on the municipal codes and
ordinances of hundreds of citites in the United States. This is part of a broader
interest in making law more accessible.
