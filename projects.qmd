## AI for legal epidemiology

Legal epidemiology -- understanding the effects of laws on health -- requires an
understanding of what the law is. But laws are spread across jurisdictions and
different levels of government, and are framed in technical language that can be
difficult to encode for analysis. Since 2024, I have been working with
collaborators on a [project](proj/legal-epi.html) to apply large language models
and modern retrieval methods to make encoding of laws easier, focusing on the
municipal codes and ordinances of hundreds of citites in the United States. This
is part of a broader interest in making law more accessible.
