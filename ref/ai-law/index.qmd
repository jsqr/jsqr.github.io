## Background

I came to law school after spending several years doing data analysis and modeling
in the physical sciences and finance. In contrast to those fields, legal practice
seemed old-fashioned. How could I automate a process? How could I make sense of
everything I was reading? Are we still in the nineteenth century or what?  For all
of its zeal to tackle new problems, law remained in many ways stuck in the past
when it came to actually doing the work. It was frustrating, and I even wrote a
[Note](https://jolt.law.harvard.edu/articles/pdf/v21/21HarvJLTech589.pdf) about
it as a kind of protest.

We're now in a different era, and the current crop of transformer-based language
models promises to make lots of ideas that were enticingly out of reach a decade
or two ago much closer. How can we take advantage of the new AI tools?
